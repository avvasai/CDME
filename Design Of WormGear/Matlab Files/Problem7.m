% Program for Design of Worm Gear, Problem 7.
% 
% Problem Statement:Design a worm gear drive to transmit 2 kW of power at 1000 
% rpm. The speed ratio is 20 and centre distance is 200 mm. Assume the number 
% of teeth on worm wheel to be 40 and number of starts on worm to be 2. Assume 
% hardened steel worm and phosphor bronze wheel for which Ïƒd = 55 N/mm2 . Check 
% the gear from stand point of strength and wear if load stress factor, K = 0.69 
% MPa. If the amount of heat generated is 1.7 kW, check whether artificial cooling 
% is necessary or not for a temperature rise for 40 degree C.
