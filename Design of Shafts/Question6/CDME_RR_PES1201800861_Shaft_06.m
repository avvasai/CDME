% Program for design of shaft, Problem Number 6.
% 
% Problem Statement:A line shaft is to transmit 30 kW at 160 rpm. It is driven 
% by a motor placed directly below it by means of a belt running on a 1 m diameter 
% pulley keyed to the end of shaft. The tension on the tight side of the belt 
% is 2.5 times that on the slack side and the centre of the pulley overhangs 150mm 
% beyond the centre line of the end bearing. Determine the diameter of the shaft, 
% if the allowable shear stress is 60 N/mm2 and the pulley weighs 1600 N. Assume 
% minor shock conditions.

% For a belt drive:

T1 = T_sol.T1_temp
T2 = T_sol.T2_temp

% Total load acting on the shaft = total belt tension + weight of the pulley

F = T1 + T2 + W

% Using the table for loads we get:

Cm = 2;
Ct = 1.5;

% Using the maximum shear stress theory.
% 
% Maximan stress is taken as one for the sake of the function to short circuit. 
% zero could be given but it would yield and inf value.
